# Homebridge Tasmota Garage Door Opener

This is a [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin to connect with a Sonoff Relay Board with Tasmota firmware and open/close garage doors using HTTP requests via the Home app on iOS using Homekit.

Modified after https://github.com/atombarel/homebridge-tasmota-garage-opener for my needs.

Features are:

- Can set autoclosing timer
- Can set opening and closure timers different from each other
- Can set also 0 as openCloseTime, useful for doors or gates with locks that can be open but not closed again
- Can choose the relay to trigger (mapping done in index.js, donâ€™t know if they are the same for every Sonoff)


Just add the following config to your homebridge config file located at this (default) path `~/.homebridge/config.json`.

```json
{
  "bridge": {
    "name": "Homebridge",
    "username": "CC:22:3D:E3:CE:50",
    "port": 51826,
    "pin": "031-45-154"
  },

  "description": "",

  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "HTTP Tasmota Garage Door Opener",
      "name": "Garage Door",
      "ip": "192.168.0.85",
      "password": "",
      "doorRelayPin": 1,
      "openCloseTime": 15000,
      "openingTime": 15000,
      "closureTime": 15000,
      "timeBeforeClosure": 30000
    }
  ],

  "platforms": [
  ]
}
```

openingTime and closureTime should be used only if opening and closure times are different.

Also a openCloseTime = 0 can be set for these doors/gates that have just a lock to open. The advantage of using this instead of a common switch is that Apple requires all security Homekit devices to ask for passcode / TouchID / FaceID before triggering this kind of devices.
No more wrong taps on the door unlock!
